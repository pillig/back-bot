# Back Bot
### A bot for the best joke of all time

## THIS BOT CAN BE RUN THROUGH DOCKER OR LOCALLY!
If Docker is setup and the daemon is running, simply change the
`docker-compose.yml.example` file to contain you bot API token and rename
the file to `docker-compose.yml`. Then, just run:

```shell_session
  $ docker-compose up
```

##Without Docker...

## Dependencies

#### Install discord.py

```shell_session
  $ pip install discord
```

#### Install pynacl

```shell_session
  $ pip install pynacl
```

    Good luck!
    Make sure the path environment variable points to the executable folder!
